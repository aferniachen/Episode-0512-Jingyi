# ðŸ•’ Countdown Program

This is a simple Python script that counts down from a specified number to zero, printing each number per second, then ends with **"Blast off!"** ðŸš€

## ðŸ“‚ File

- `countdown.py`: The main script containing the countdown logic.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

The program defines a `countdown(n)` function that:
1. Prints each number from `n` to 1, one second apart.
2. Displays `"Blast off!"` when complete.

This is great for practicing basic loops, functions, and timing in Python.
